        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <p class="conclusion-heading">Conclusion:</p>
        <p>
            The statistical and diagnostic analyses reveal significant variations in the GDP composition across Brazil's regions. 
            While agriculture is a crucial sector in the Centro-Oeste and Norte regions, the Sudeste and Sul regions have a 
            stronger emphasis on industry and services. The public sector maintains a relatively stable contribution across 
            all regions, with slight variations in its percentage share. These insights can help policymakers and economists tailor 
            regional development strategies to harness each region's strengths and address its unique challenges.
