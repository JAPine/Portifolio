            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This report provides a detailed analysis of Brazil's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from 1985 to 2020, focusing on sectors 
                like Agriculture, Industry, Services, and the Public Sector. Descriptive and diagnostic analyses are conducted wherein significant 
                variations in GDP composition are observed among regions, with agriculture being crucial in some and industry and services in others. 
                The public sector maintains stability across regions. These insights can inform policymakers and economists in tailoring regional 
                development strategies to capitalize on strengths and address challenges.

        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <p class="conclusion-heading">Conclusion:</p>
        <p>
            The statistical and diagnostic analyses reveal significant variations in the GDP composition across Brazil's regions. 
            While agriculture is a crucial sector in the Centro-Oeste and Norte regions, the Sudeste and Sul regions have a 
            stronger emphasis on industry and services. The public sector maintains a relatively stable contribution across 
            all regions, with slight variations in its percentage share. These insights can help policymakers and economists tailor 
            regional development strategies to harness each region's strengths and address its unique challenges.
